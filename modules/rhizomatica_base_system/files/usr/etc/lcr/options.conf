# are possible using the admin tool.

# The log file can be used to track actions by the LCR. Omit the parameter
# to turn off log file. By default, log file is located inside the directory
# "/usr/local/lcr/log".
#log /usr/local/lcr/log

# Use "alaw" (default) or "ulaw" samples.
alaw

# The LCR should run as real time process. Because audio is streamed and
# ISDN protocol requires a certain response time, we must have high priority.
# By default, the process runs an normal priority, lika most processes do.
# To debug, it is whise to use "schedule" with no parameter to turn off
# realtime scheduling. In case of an endless loop bug, LCR will take
# all CPU time forever - your machine hangs.
#schedule 0

# Use tone sets (default= tones_american).
# Tones/announcements are streamed from user space. It is possible to use
# the module "mISDN_dsp.o" instead. It provides simple tones with much less cpu
# usage. If supported by special hardware, tones are loops that require no
# bus/cpu load at all, except when the tone changes.
# Use parameter "american", "german", or "oldgerman". "oldgerman" sounds like
# the old german telephone system used until end of year 1998.
# This can be overridden by the the tones_dir in the interface.conf.
# Both options.conf and interface.conf can be overridden by extension setting.
#tones_dir tones_american

# Fetch tone sets as specified here.
# The tone sets will be loaded during startup, and no harddisk access is
# required. Specify all tone sets seperated by komma.
# By default, no tone is fetched. Tone sets, that are not specified here, will
# be streamed from hard disk.
# Don't use spaces to seperate!
#fetch_tones tones_american,tones_german,vbox_english,vbox_german

# Prefix to dial national call (default= 0).
# If you omit the prefix, all subscriber numbers are national numbers.
# (example: Danmark)
#national 0

# Prefix to dial international call (default= 00).
# If you omit the prefix, all subscriber numbers are international numbers.
#international 00

# On external calls, dialing can be done via normal called party number
# information element or via keypad facility. Some telephone systems require
# dialing via keypad to enable/disable special functions.
# By default keypad facility is disabled.
#keypad

# For calls to external where caller id is not available, this id is used.
# It is sent of type "subscriber number". This ID is only usefull if the
# external line will not screen caller id. It will be sent anonymous.
# If you don't know what to use it for, you don't need it.
# Default is nothing.
#dummyid 0

# Source email address of the LCR. E.g. it is used when sending a mail
# from the voice box. It is not the address the mails are sent to.
# Most mail servers require an existing domain in order to accept mails.
#email lcr@your.domain

# Directory to write lock file and admin socket file to.
# If /var/run does not have the rights to run LCR, you may choose /var/tmp
# or any directory with the appropiet rights LCR runs with.
#lock /var/run

# Change rights of LCR socket, where lcradmin or chan_lcr connects to.
# By default 700 (user only) rights are set. If Asterisk runs with a different
# user, the rights may be changed to all users (777).
# Rights must have 0 in front, if octal values above are used.
#socketrights 0700

# Change user of LCR socket, where lcradmin or chan_lcr connects to.
# So: change to asterisk, if you have asterisk run as user "asterisk" e.g.
#socketuser asterisk

# Change group of LCR socket, where lcradmin or chan_lcr connects to.
# So: change to asterisk, if you have asterisk run in group "asterisk" e.g.
#socketgroup asterisk

# Enable polling in main loop.
# This feature is temporarily for test purpose. Don't enable it
