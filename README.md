# Rhizomatica Puppet repository

Here you will find all the modules which we are currently using in the Rhizomatica infrastructure.
Some of them are directly pulled from PuppetForge or github. A bunch are included as submodules, others are directly imported in the repository.
To have a working repo, you should also include all the submodules:

	git submodule init
	git submodule update
